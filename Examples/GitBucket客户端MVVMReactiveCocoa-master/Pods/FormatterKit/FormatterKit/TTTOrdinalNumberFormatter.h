/**
 Instances of `TTTOrdinalNumberFormatter` create localized ordinal string representations of `NSNumber` objects.

 Each instance has a default number style of `NSNumberFormatterNoStyle`, does not allow floats nor generates decimal numbers, has a rounding mode of `NSNumberFormatterRoundFloor`, a minimum value of @0, and is has leniency turned on.

 For example, the numbers `@1`, `@2`, and `@3` would be formatted as `@"1st"`, `@"2nd"`, and `@"3rd"` in English.
